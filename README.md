# TwitterBot
Some Twitter API Functionality, Basic Functions, I am planning to continue this project by developing a Semantic analysis algorithm that would be able to make an appropriate response given the text from a target tweet. Perhaps some further Analysis such as rating a tweets performance and its correlation to the Words/ +/- connotation of the words that make up the tweet. Further Development needed

Im sure if you have glanced at the code you know that when I created the spreadsheets i put the ID and Profile names in two seperate arrays. Because of this when I push the data into the spreadsheet there is a mismatch between ID and Account name. It doesnt affect the rest of the program (As it stands currently) however if you were to try to look up the id of someone, it is very likely that the id in the spreadsheet does not match the id returned by getUserID function. Changes will be made in the future when I return to this project!
