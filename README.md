Some Twitter API Functionality, Basic Functions

Something important I wanted to highlight: 

In the main file inside the JunkWork1 Function (please pardon the horrendous function names I promise I have worked on this since this repository was active) you will notice I go through each user in the Target_Accounts_Spoke_To2 worksheet and I grab the most recent accounts these target account had mentioned in their tweets and store these users in the spokeToo variable. I then proceeded to save this names into the workbook and exit the function. 

Later in Junkwork2 function I reopen the work book and follow all of the users gathered in JunkWork1. Effectively following all of the accounts that had conversations with the accounts listed in Target_Accounts_v2. The reason I highlighted this is because the General Idea of this function (Following accounts assosciated with a target account) was actually implemented as a core feature to twitter itself (When you follow an account on twitter mobile it will open up an option to follow more related accounts with the "Follow All" button!)
